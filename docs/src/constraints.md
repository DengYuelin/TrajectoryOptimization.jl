## Creating Constraint Sets
The easiest way to set up the constraints for your problem is through the [`ConstraintList`](@ref).
This structure simply holds a vector of all the constraints in the trajectory optimization problem.
The easiest way to start is to create an empty [`ConstraintList`](@ref):
```julia
cons = ConstraintList(n,m,N)
```

### Adding Constraints
You can add any constraint (the list of currently implemented constraints is given in the following
section) to the constraint set using the [`add_constraint!`](@ref) method. For example, if we
want to add control limits and an final goal constraint to our problem, we do this by creating
a `ConstraintList` and subsequently adding the constraints:
```julia
# Dimensions of our problem
n,m,N = 4,1,51    # 51 knot points

# Create our list of constraints
cons = ConstraintList(n,m,N)

# Create the goal constraint
xf = [0,Ï€,0,0]
goalcon = GoalConstraint(xf)
add_constraint!(cons, goalcon, N)  # add to the last time step

# Create control limits
ubnd = 3
bnd = BoundConstraint(n,m, u_min=-ubnd, u_max=ubnd)
add_constraint!(cons, bnd, 1:N-1)  # add to all but the last time step
```

### Defined Constraints
The following constraints are currently defined. See their individual docstrings on details
on how to construct them, since constraint constructors are, in general, unique to the constraint.

* [`GoalConstraint`](@ref)
* [`BoundConstraint`](@ref)
* [`CircleConstraint`](@ref)
* [`SphereConstraint`](@ref)
* [`NormConstraint`](@ref)
* [`IndexedConstraint`](@ref)
